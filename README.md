A project from my UCF Coding bootcamp that showed us the basic understandings of HTML and CSS and how they are used together to create websites. We also touched on some more advanced elements like <iframe> and <a> (anchor tags) and how to apply them practically to your site. Really helped my understanding of how CSS flows and just how important it is to your webpage.
